# D&D Stenograph: An HTML based D&D 5e character sheet

Version 0.1.0

D&D character sheet with html, css, and js.

Character sheets are saved, stored, and loaded by the individual user as a JSON or TXT document.
Currently, the automatic math done is specified from a local JSON (options.json), but in the future this will be editable/uploadable by your DM.
