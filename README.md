# D&D Stenograph: An HTML based D&D 5e character sheet

> v1.6.7

A webpage-based D&D 5e character sheet.

Run the character sheet for yourself by clicking [here](https://ironbatman2715.github.io/DND-Stenograph/)!

Presently, it is up to the _individual user_ to _save, store, and upload_ their character sheet data if they want to access it again (data is saved as a JSON)!

The calculations done by the program are specified by the repository file "options.json". In the future, plans are to make this customizeable by your DM.
